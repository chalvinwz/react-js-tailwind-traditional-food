## Traditional Food List

This is an application where it lists a lot of food name and image from various country and you can also search food by the country.

### What I used to build this application:

- [React.js](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI.
- [Spoonacular Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/) for the API endpoint.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying the application.
